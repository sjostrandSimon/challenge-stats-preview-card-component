# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component solution

I used grid instead of flex on the card container because i wanted equal size for the columns.

Had a hard time finding the right shade for the purple overlay on the image. I learned to use the "background-image" property to import the image from CSS to create an overlay, however that gave some strange padding for two of the sides of the image. Dont know how to fix that, so i asked ChatGPT for another solution.

Also struggled alot trying to give more space between the image and the content to the left. Gap property squished the image, and giving the left content some padding right made the text break the line, which i understand. I ended up doing some </br> and few other not so good solutions.
